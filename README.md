# Diamond Price Prediction

Our Diamond Price Prediction project harnesses the power of machine learning, specifically Random Forest Regression, to forecast the price of diamonds with exceptional accuracy. Trained on a comprehensive dataset containing crucial features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions, the model epitomizes the proficiency of our system in capturing intricate patterns and nuances within the diamond market.

## Algorithm
